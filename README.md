# Public Goods Funding POC

Welcome to our innovative Proof of Concept (POC) that revolutionizes public goods funding platforms. This POC is designed to enhance the way public projects are funded, ensuring greater efficiency, collaboration, and impact.

## Features

1. **Targeted Feature Funding:** Unlike traditional funding methods, our platform allows project owners to seek funding for specific features of their projects using GitHub branches. This granular approach enables backers to support the features they believe in the most.

2. **Streamlined Funding:** Funds are streamed to projects using the Sablier protocol, ensuring real-time and flexible financing. Contributors have the autonomy to withdraw their support if circumstances change.

3. **Branch Funding Marketplace:** Our platform acts as a marketplace for branch funding. Project owners can list their desired features, and backers can allocate resources to the features that align with their interests and values.

## Why It Matters

- **Efficient Resource Allocation:** Our POC promotes efficient allocation of resources by allowing backers to fund specific features that drive the most impact. This targeted approach ensures that every contribution counts.

- **Collaboration and Innovation:** By encouraging collaboration between project owners and backers, our platform fosters innovation and the development of high-impact features that resonate with the community.

- **Flexibility for Contributors:** The use of the Sablier protocol provides contributors with flexibility. They can support projects with confidence, knowing that they can withdraw their funding if circumstances change.

Join us on this exciting journey to transform public goods funding. Together, we're building a future where innovation, collaboration, and targeted impact drive positive change.
